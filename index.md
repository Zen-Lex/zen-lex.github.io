<br>
Hello, I'm Julien, french student in Computer Science looking for new adventures.

Since 2020, I'm developping skills on my own or in college, mostly in full-stack software and web developmnent. And I'm thrilled to continue du learn and discover for the years to come.

Feel free to take a look at my [projects](/projects) and my [resume](/assets/files/en/CV_IT_photo_2022.pdf) to learn more about myself or contact me. ðŸ˜Š
